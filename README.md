I analyzed 30 years of Irish weather data, including temperature and rainfall, using various statistical and machine learning techniques to understand the data and identify trends. Additionally, I applied a deep learning model, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to the data.

This model is not ideal for weather forecasting. Large models like those used by the IPCC consider many more factors, such as global temperatures, glacier conditions, and ice thickness at the poles.

First, I explored the data with some analytical plots and used machine learning classifications with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Then, I performed statistical analyses using ARIMA and SARIMAX models and used Facebook's Prophet model to identify trends. Next, I applied regression machine learning models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and finally, I used the LSTM deep learning model.

I forecasted future temperatures with the LSTM model, though it is not perfect for this purpose. Based on the LSTM model, the mean temperature in Ireland in 2035 will be around 12.5°C ,in last 30 years that was : 9.968 nearly 2.5°C degrees difference!
